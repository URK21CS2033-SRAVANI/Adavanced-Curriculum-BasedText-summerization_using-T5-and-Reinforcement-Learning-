## Overview
This project explores an advanced approach to abstractive text summarization by integrating:
- The T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model,
- Curriculum Learning (training from easy to hard tasks), and
- Reinforcement Learning (reward-based optimization).

It aims to generate coherent, factually accurate, and concise summaries for long documents across domains like research, business, and healthcare.

## Features
- üîç Curriculum Learning-based training pipeline
- üß† Reinforcement Learning with custom reward function
- ü§ñ T5 fine-tuning using Hugging Face Transformers
- üìä ROUGE and BLEU evaluation metrics
- üåç Scalable and modular system

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (T5)
- PyTorch
- Stable Baselines3 (for RL)
- NLTK, ROUGE
- Streamlit (optional UI)
**
Streamlit is used:**
streamlit run src/app.py
