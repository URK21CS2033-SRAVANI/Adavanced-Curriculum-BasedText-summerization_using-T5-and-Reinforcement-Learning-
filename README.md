ðŸ“š **Advanced Curriculum-Based Abstractive Text Summarization with T5 and Reinforcement Learning**
This project explores an advanced approach to abstractive text summarization by combining the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) language model with a Curriculum Learning strategy and Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization.

ðŸš€ **Key Features**
âœ¨ Abstractive Summarization using pre-trained T5 transformer for generating human-like summaries.

ðŸŽ“ Curriculum Learning to gradually expose the model to more complex summaries, improving generalization and training efficiency.

ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning (e.g., using policy gradients) to fine-tune summaries with task-specific rewards such as ROUGE scores.

ðŸ“ˆ Enhanced performance through hybrid training combining supervised and reward-driven optimization.

**ðŸ“Š Results**
Achieved improved ROUGE scores over baseline T5 summarization.

Demonstrated better coherence and fluency with curriculum-guided training.

Efficient convergence through reinforcement learning-based reward shaping.
